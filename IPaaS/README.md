# Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS)

IPaaS is a set of Azure services that are meant to satisfy most integration patteners. The main integration architecture patterns are:

- EDA Event-Driven Architecture
    - Pub/Sub
    - Event Notification (ie: webhooks)
    - ...
    
- API-driven architectutre
- Messaging
- Data-specific patterns (ie: ETL and ELT, File Transert, etc.)

On top, these patterns often rely on orchestrations or choreographies.
