# Attention Points
## (1) User traffic routing 
In this setup, the load balancing algorithm defined in Front Door does not matter because we use APIM's main HTTP endpoint to route traffic to the regional gateway units. APIM's built-in load balancing algorithm is driven by a built-in Traffic Manager instance (DNS-based) witht the *Performance-based* routing algorithm, which by default will send users to the closest region.

## (2) Origin Group
### Load balancing
In this setup, API management is in a driving seat because I have used APIM's main endpoint. APIM will be default perform geo-routing and fallback to another region than the user's should a regional gateway unit not be responsive anymore. 
One downside of this approach is that the load balancing algorithm cannot be changed at the level of Front Door, since it forwards all traffic to that single origin. However, a direct benefit is that you won't have to touch Front Door should you add a new APIM region.
### Probing
To probe your backend APIs, you can either use APIM's default health check endpoint */status0123456789abcdef*, either use a custom endpoint. I typically prefer the latter because APIM's health might be perfectly fine but it won't reflect the health of your backend services. In case you create a custom endpoint, go to item number 5 below. 
### Custom Domains
While you will typically work with a custom front end domain, you can afford to work with APIM's default domain if you plan to use Front Door as the single entry point. In this case, the APIM default domain is shielded off by Front Door. If you still want to go for your own domain and certificate for APIM, beware that in 12/23, Front Door does not support custom Certificate Authorities for TLS to the origin.

## (3) Bring your own certificate with Key Vault and a custom DNS domain.
At the time of writing (12/23), Key Vault must be internet facing to let Front Door pull the certificate. You can use Front Door's system identity to pull the certificate. The RBAC role *Key Vault Secrets User* must be granted to the identity. Make sure to use Azure RBAC with Key Vault instead of legacy *Access Policies*. A CNAME record pointing to your endpoint must be added into your public DNS.


## (4) API Management (APIM) gateway units and management plane.
### Internet facing APIM
In this setup, the primary region for APIM is is West Europe. At the time of writing (12/23), APIM must be internet facing because Front Door is unable to see APIM's internal load balancer when used in VNET internal mode. Private Link Service is not an option for the time being. 
Therefoere, in this setup, it integrates with a virtual network in External mode. Each gateway unit sits in its corresponding regional virtual network. The subnets in which gateway units are deployed are protected by their respective network security group. 
Traffic can be restricted to [APIM's control plane requirements] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet?tabs=stv2) as well as to the Front Door Backend Service Tag. Note that this does not restrict traffic to your Front Door instance, but to the Front Door service at large. This already helps block bot calls and the likes. In 11/23, the only way to keep APIM fully private is to put an Application Gateway instance in front of it. However, you'd need one instance per region, which increases costs and has a performance impact because you add an extra hop. The reason why it is still prefered to work with APIM External mode than a non-VNET-integrated APIM is that APIM's outbound traffic will have access to the private perimeter. So, the upstream backends can be fully private. While this can also be achieved with Standard V2, multi-region is only available in the Premium tier.
### Management plane
Should the primary region become unavailable, the other gateway units can still function. It will however not be possible to change anything in the APIM config until the primary region comes back.
### High-Availability
While multi-region Gateways offer high availability by default, you can still increase the level of each region by enabling zone redundancy.

## (5) Global Policy
To restrict traffic to your own Front Door instance, you can write a policy that checks the presence of the HTTP request header named *X-Azure-FDID*. This header is written by Front Door and contains the unique identifier of your Front Door instance.
This global policy makes sure all calls have to go to Front Door before hitting APIM. If you would still like to tap into specific products/APIs, you might either define this policy at another scope, either break inheritance at a lower scope.
You should store Front Door's unique ID in a named value.

Note that there is an ongoing preview to integrate Front Door with APIM behind a private endpoint. In such a setup, you would not especially be forced to check the *X-Azure-FDID* request header.

## (6) API-level Policy
When Azure API Management is used in a multi-region setup, you cannot specify the backend service in the API settings, because you do not know in advance which regional gateway unit will be chosen. Therefore, you must write a *set-backend-service* policy to route traffic dynamically according to the chosen gateway unit. The logic is rather simple, if the EU Gateway is chosen, you route to the EU backend. You can add extra availability logic to still fallback on the other region should the default backend not be available. This heavily depends on your probing logic defined at the level of Front Door. 

## (7) Health probe endpoint
If you prefer not to rely on APIM's default health check endpoint, make sure to have an API operation that you can call using a subscription key. You cannot have an OAUTH2-protected endpoint because Front Door simply performs GET or HEAD queries against the endpoint. Using a key is a convenient way to protect the probing endpoint. Depending on the number of APIs you have, you might write a logic that reflects the true health of your backends. Whatever you do, always make sure to support the HEAD verb to reduce bandwidth (and extra costs). If you want an endpoint that returns more info about the health of your system, make sure to craft it separetely and not use it as a target of the Front Door probe. The reason is that Front Door makes a lot of requests against the probe endpoint and this can result in high bandwith usage, as well as high compute depending on what you're doing to determine the health of your system.
