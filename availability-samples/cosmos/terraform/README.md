# Availabilty Samples


The purpose of this code is to demonstrate failover groups. Test it along with the
provided console app which you can run while you failover to see the behavior.
- I'm opening those SQL servers to the entire world
- I'm using SQL Authentication instead of Entra ID

This is by no means representative of what you should do in the real world but is more than enough to illustrate the failover behavior of the failover groups.
